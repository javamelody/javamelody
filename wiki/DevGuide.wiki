= Nightly build, compilation and development of Java Melody =

=== Download nightly build ===

	You can download the [https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/ nightly build] (snapshot from trunk), from [http://www.cloudbees.com/ CloudBees] Jenkins CI. <a href='http://www.cloudbees.com/'><img src='http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/src/site/resources/images/Button-Built-on-CB-1.png' width='20%' alt='Built on CloudBees' /></a>

=== Browsing the sources and javadoc ===

	You can [http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/browse/ browse] the development sources from svn or you can [http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/downloads/list download] the zip file of a release which includes the sources of that release.

	You can also browse the latest [https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/site/apidocs/index.html javadoc], [https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/site/xref/index.html sources] and other [https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/ reports] from the [http://www.cloudbees.com/ CloudBees] Jenkins CI (snapshot from trunk).

	You can also browse the sources at [http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.bull.javamelody/javamelody-core/1.37.0/net/bull/javamelody/MonitoringFilter.java grepcode] with point and click, except that grepcode does not display the latest version in general.

=== Building from sources ===

	The zip file available in "[http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/downloads/list Download]" contains the java sources with an [http://ant.apache.org ant] script build.xml and a pom.xml file for [http://maven.apache.org maven]
	and contains also the javadoc, the eclipse project, the jar files.
	If you want to rebuild the development version and not a particular release, you have to do an anonymous checkout from 
	[http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/] (with your favorite IDE such as Eclipse or with [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] if Windows)

	After decompressing the zip file or after the checkout, you can use the "all" target of the ant script (without maven) to recompile from sources
	and to build the javamelody.jar, jira-javamelody.jar and javamelody.war files which are those available in "Download".
	You must define the environment variable JAVA_HOME with the path
	of a JDK 1.7 to compile the sources.

	For example:

{{{
	<path_to_ant>/bin/ant -f <path_to_javamelody>/build.xml all
}}}

	You can also use the maven goals "clean site" to build a maven site with documentations and reports on analysis of sources
	or on unit tests (checkstyle, findbugs, pmd, cpd, junit, cobertura). You will need Maven 3.0.4 or later for that.


=== Import in Eclipse the sources of current development version ===

To import from the SVN server the sources of the version currently in development, with Eclipse 4.2 using a JDK 1.7 and the subversion plugin (maven plugin m2e is also recommended to simplify these steps):
	
	* Click the task Import in File menu
	
	* Choose SVN, Project from SVN
	
	* To create a SVN repository, write the URL http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core (no authentication) then click Next
	
	* Choose the resource of URL http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core (Select again the URL in the combo-box if needed)
	
	* Click Finish
	
	* Eclipse imports the project javamelody-core with the sources, then it compiles all
	(maven must works and be connected to download the dependencies,
	otherwise add them manually in the Build-Path from src/main/lib and src/test/test-webapp/WEB-INF/lib)
	
	* It is also possible to import the projects javamelody-test-webapp and javamelody-collector-server which are next to javamelody-core in SVN

	
To rebuild the jar and the war of JavaMelody:
	
	* Do a right-click on the build.xml file in the project javamelody-core, then select Run As, Ant Build
	which will launch the task by default "all" of the ant script. (Note: in the same script, the task "test" launches the unit tests.)
	
	* Wait about 20 seconds for the end of the execution of the script
	
	* Do a Refresh (F5) on the project javamelody-core
	
	* In the files of the project, the javamelody.zip file appears and contains the rebuilt jars and war of javamelody

	
After some weeks for example, in order to update your sources with the new developments:
	
	* Do a right-click on the project javamelody-core, then select Team, Update


=== Development ===

	The development is done with [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] in its latest version and with the jdk 1.7 at least for compilation.
	
	The manager of sources is Subversion at	[http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/]

	The charset of files is UTF-8. The Eclipse configuration is supplied in sources with the configuration of
	code formater, clean-up, warnings and of checkstyle, pmd, findbugs and lint4j plugins.
	The infinitest eclipse plugin is also recommended.

	The official languages of the project are french for javadoc but english for technical terms.
	(This provides a clean separation between functional and technical vocabulary, given that you speak French obviously).

	The diagrams in the OpenOffice [http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/src/site/resources/Map.odp map] or the other [http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/src/site/resources/MethodCallsMap.odp one] may help to understand.


=== Tests ===

	The JUnit tests can be launched with the "test" target of the ant script, or with maven or in [ContinuousIntegration].

	The manual tests are written in the OpenOffice [http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/src/site/resources/Test%20plan.ods Test plan].

=== Plugins ===

	[https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/net.bull.javamelody JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo plugin] : The sources for the JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo plugin are with the sources of JavaMelody at [http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/]. As said above, you can use the "all" target of the ant script to build the jira-javamelody.jar file.

	[http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring Jenkins / Hudson plugin] : The manager of sources for the Jenkins / Hudson Monitoring plugin is Subversion at [http://svn.jenkins-ci.org/trunk/hudson/plugins/monitoring/] (Git mirror at [https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin]). Use maven commands "mvn hpi:run" or "mvn package" like for all [http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial Jenkins / Hudson plugins].

	[http://www.grails.org/plugin/grails-melody Grails plugin] : The manager of sources for the JavaMelody Grails plugin is Subversion at [http://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins/grails-grails-melody/trunk/]

	[https://github.com/sbower/nagios_javamelody_plugin Nagios plugin] : There is also a Nagios plugin by Shawn Bower based on a command reading the last values in the RRD files (it starts a JVM for each value, which may not scale a lot). The manager of sources is Git at [https://github.com/sbower/nagios_javamelody_plugin]
